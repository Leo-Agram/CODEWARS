Learning Javascript one kyu at a time.


These are my solutions to current katas I have solved. My profile in Codewars can be found [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/Leo-Agram)

IMPORTANT NOTE:

This repository includes my own solutions as a beginner. I am just posting them to help me keep the pace, code on a daily basis, and improve as a developer. Please DO NOT use them to cheat on the platform! In this regard, I strongly encourage you to follow these code of honor:

- Codewarriors are strongly encouraged not to look at my solutions until they have completed it themselves or at least took the time to think about their own approaches.
- Codewarriors should not submit my solutions as their own.
- I will not be accepting contributions of any form to this repo.
- Creating a repository like this is discouraged by Codewars. (Sorry Codewars! But I need this for practice.)

Thank you!
